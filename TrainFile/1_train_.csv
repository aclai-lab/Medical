0,"International High-Risk Clones Among Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase-Producing  in Dhaka, Bangladesh.   is a major extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organism responsible for the rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that has compromised our ability to treat infections. Baseline data on population structure, virulence, and resistance mechanisms in  lineages from developing countries such as Bangladesh are lacking.  Whole-genome sequencing was performed for 46 ESBL- isolates cultured from patient samples at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b)-Dhaka. Sequence data were analyzed to glean details of AMR, virulence, and phylogenetic and molecular markers of  lineages.  Genome comparison revealed presence of all major high-risk clones including sequence type 131 (ST131) (46%), ST405 (13%), ST648 (7%), ST410 (4.3%), ST38 (2%), ST73 (2%), and ST1193 (2%). The predominant ESBL gene and plasmid combination were       and FII-FIA-FIB detected in diverse  phylogroups and STs. The     (9%) gene was present in prominent  STs. One (2%) positive ST1011 , coharboring     gene, was detected. The extraintestinal pathogenic  genotype was associated with specific  lineages. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome phylogeny largely showed correlation with phylogroups, serogroups, and  types. Majority of these isolates were susceptible to amikacin (93%), imipenem (93%), and nitrofurantoin (83%).  Our study reveals a high diversity of  lineages among ESBL-producing  from Dhaka. This study suggests ongoing circulation of ST131 and all major non-ST131 high-risk clones that are strongly associated with cephalosporin resistance and virulence genes. These findings warrant prospective monitoring of high-risk clones, which would otherwise worsen the AMR crises."
0,"Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Producing- Isolated From Irrigation Waters and Produce in Ecuador. In cities across the globe, the majority of wastewater - that includes drug resistant and pathogenic bacteria among other contaminants - is released into streams untreated. This water is often subsequently used for irrigation of pastures and produce. This use of wastewater-contaminated streams allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to potentially cycle back to humans through agricultural products. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  isolated from produce and irrigation water across 17 provinces of Ecuador. A total of 117 vegetable samples, 119 fruit samples, and 38 irrigation water samples were analyzed. Results showed that 11% of the samples were positive for  including 11 irrigation water samples (29%), and samples of 13 vegetables (11%), and 11 fruits (9%). Among the 165  isolates cultured, 96 (58%) had the ESBL phenotype, and 58% of ESBL producing  came from irrigation water samples, 11% from vegetables, and 30% from fruits. The    ,  , and   genes were the most frequently found gene associated with the ESBL phenotype and coincided with the   alleles associated with human infections in Ecuador. Three isolates had the mcr-1 gene which is responsible for colistin resistance. This report provides evidence of the potential role of irrigation water in the growing antimicrobial resistance crisis in Ecuador."

0,"Prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in wastewater: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Wastewater is considered a hotspot niche of multi-drug and pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae-producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL-E). Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of ESBL-E in different wastewater sources. Different databases (Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) were searched from inception to March 2021. Data were analyzed using random-effects modeling, and subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to ascertain heterogeneity among the subgroups. Fifty-seven observational studies were selected, and the pooled prevalence of ESBL-E in wastewater was 24.81% (95% CI, 19.28-30.77). Escherichia coli had the highest ESBL prevalence. The blaCTX-M genes were the most prevalent in the selected studies (66.56%). The pooled prevalence of ESBL was significantly higher in reports from America (39.91%, 95% CI, 21.82-59.51) and reports studying hospital and untreated wastewaters (33.98%, 95% CI, 23.82-44.91 and 27.36%, 95% CI, 19.12-36.42). Overall, this meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of ESBL-E in wastewater is increasing over time and that hospital wastewater is the most important repository of ESBL-E. Therefore, there is a need for developing new sewage treatment systems that decrease the introduction of resistant bacteria and antibiotic residues."

The World Health Organization (WHO) has been implementing antimicrobial surveillance with a ""One Health"" approach, known as the Global Surveillance ESBL  Tricycle Project. We describe the implementation of the Tricycle Project (pilot) in Indonesia, focusing on its results, challenges and recommendations. The samples were 116 patients with bloodstream infections caused by ESBL , 100 rectal swabs collected from pregnant women, 240 cecums of broiler, and 119 environmental samples, using the standardized method according to the guidelines. ESBL-producing  was found in 40 (40%) of the 100 pregnant women, while the proportion of ESBL-producing  was 57.7% among the total -induced bloodstream infections. ESBL-producing  was isolated from 161 (67.1%) out of 240 broilers. On the other hand, the average concentration of  in the water samples was 2.0 × 10 CFU/100 mL, and the ratio of ESBL-producing  was 12.8% of total . Unfortunately, 56.7% of questionnaires for patients were incomplete. The Tricycle Project (pilot) identified that the proportion of ESBL-producing  was very high in all types of samples, and several challenges and obstacles were encountered during the implementation of the study in Indonesia. The finding of this study have implication to health/the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance. We recommend continuing this project and extending this study to other provinces to determine the AMR burden as the baseline in planning AMR control strategies in Indonesia. We also recommend improving the protocol of this study to minimize obstacles in the field."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of fecal ESBL-producing  () in pigs on large and small farms in Latvia, to characterize beta-lactamase genes and establish an antimicrobial resistance profile. Fecal samples (n = 615) were collected from 4-week, 5-week, 6-week, 8-week, 12-week and 20-week-old piglets, pigs and sows on four large farms (L1, L2, L3, L4) and three small farms (S1, S2, S3) in Latvia. ChromArt ESBL agar and combination disc tests were used for the screening and confirmation of ESBL-producing . The antimicrobial resistance was determined by the disc diffusion method and ESBL genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequently, ESBL-producing .  was confirmed on three large farms, L1 (64.3%), L2 (29.9%), L3 (10.7%) and one small farm, S1 (47.5%); n = 144 (23.4%). The prevalence of ESBL-producing  differed considerably between the large and small farm groups (26.9% vs. 12.7%). Of ESBL  isolates, 96% were multidrug-resistant (MDR), demonstrating there were more extensive MDR phenotypes on large farms. The distribution of ESBL genes was  (94%),&nbsp; (86%) and  (48%). On the small farm,  dominated, thus demonstrating a positive association with resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime and cefixime, while on the large farms,  with a positive association to cephalexin and several non-beta lactam antibiotics dominated. The results indicated the prevalence of a broad variety of ESBL-producing  among the small and large farms, putting the larger farms at a higher risk. Individual monitoring of ESBL and their antimicrobial resistance could be an important step in revealing hazardous MDR ESBL-producing  strains and reviewing the management of antibiotic use."

1,"Antibiotic Resistance Profiles and Molecular Characteristics of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-Producing  and  Isolated From Shrimp Aquaculture Farms in Kerala, India. This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  and  in selected shrimp aquaculture farms ( = 37) in Kerala, South India and to characterize the isolates using molecular tools. Overall, a low prevalence of ESBL-producers was found in the farms, most likely due to the reduced antibiotic usage in the shrimp farming sector. Out of the 261 samples (77 shrimp and 92 each of water and sediment), 14 (5.4%) tested positive for ESBL- or ESBL-. A total of 32 ESBL- and 15 ESBL-  were recovered from these samples. All ESBL isolates were cefotaxime-resistant with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥32 μg/ml. Of all isolates, 9 (28.1%)  and 13 (86.7%)  showed simultaneous resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Therapeutic and growth-promoting antibiotics are frequently used in broiler production. Indirect evidence indicates that these practices are linked to the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from food animals to humans, and the environment, but there is a lack of comprehensive experimental data supporting this. We investigated the effects of growth promotor (bacitracin) and therapeutic (enrofloxacin) antibiotic administration on AMR in broilers for the duration of a production cycle, using a holistic approach that integrated both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. We specifically focused on pathogen-harboring families (Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae)."

1,"Escherichia coli and Serratia fonticola ESBLs as a potential source of antibiotics resistance dissemination in the Tricity water reservoirs. Despite the fact that cephalosporins are rarely used in medical or veterinary treatment, the presence of Enterobacterales strains resistant to this group of anti-bacterial drugs (ESBL) is an important issue that requires attention. Between 2019 and 2021, 14 retention reservoirs, 12 streams, 3 rivers and 1 lake situated in the Tricity area (in northern Poland) were sampled for the presence of ESBL strains. Out of 40 water samples, characteristic growth (E. coli and the KESC group) on Chromagar ESBL plates was observed for 33 samples. The average number of ESBL E. coli was 42±132 CFU/100 ml, while the KESC group was 73±147 CFU/100 ml. Out of 33 positive samples, 57 ESBL Enterobacterales strains were isolated, of which the most abundant species were E. coli (13 isolates) and S. fonticola (23 isolates). The E. coli ESBL isolates not only showed resistance to third generation cephalosporins but also to antibiotics from other groups, such as fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides. The S. fonticola ESBL isolates were also found to be mainly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of 5 imipenem and 2 ertapenem-resistant strains. These strains presented highly diverse fingerprinting profiles, as well as significant differences in phenotypic traits helpful for survival in the environment, such as biofilm formation and motility. Moreover, biofilm formation and the swimming ability were species and temperature dependent. We confirmed the presence of highly diverse ESBL strains with multiple drug resistance patterns in the Tricity water reservoirs. This could possibly pose a threat to human health and create a suitable ground for acquiring antibiotics resistance in the natural environment."
1,"High ESBL-E colonization rate among children in Gabon: a follow-up study. A previous study conducted in Gabon, Central Africa, in 2010/11 found a high colonization rate with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E) among children of ~34 %. Eight years later, we aimed to reassess the ESBL-E rate and previously identified risk factors for colonization in children from Gabon. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study in 2018 on 92 outpatients under 5 years of age with diarrhoea in Lambaréné, Gabon, in whom a rectal swab was obtained at the initial medical encounter (baseline). Fifty-eight of these provided a further rectal swab 1 week afterwards. ESBL-E colonization was assessed [following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)], and in confirmed ESBL-E isolates the susceptibility to meropenem and the prevalence of the most abundant ESBL genes,  ,  , and  , were investigated. At baseline, the ESBL-E colonization rate was 57 % (52/92; 95 % CI: 46-67). Hospitalization during the previous year, chicken consumption in the past week and young age were identified as independent risk factors for ESBL-E colonization at baseline. On day 7, the ESBL-E carriage rate was 72 % (42/58; 95 % CI: 59-83). All ESBL-E isolates (=293) were susceptible to meropenem and   was the most frequently detected β-lactamase gene. The ESBL-E colonization rate among children from Gabon is alarmingly high, with indications of further increase over recent years. While all ESBL-E strains remain currently susceptible to meropenem, in practice no adequate treatment is available locally for severe infections with such isolates. It is thus of the utmost importance to invest in improved hospital infection prevention and control measures to combat ESBL-E effectively."

2,"Occurrence of Carriage of Multidrug Resistant Enterobacteriaceae among Pregnant Women in the Primary Health Center and Hospital Setting in Surabaya, Indonesia.  The incidence of healthy individuals carrying multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), especially extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing  (ESBL-EC) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing  (ESBL-KP), is increasing worldwide. Although ESBL-E causes early or late onset of neonatal sepsis, the prevalence of ESBL-E carriage among pregnant women in Indonesia is not clear. In the present study, we compared the occurrence of carriage of ESBL-E among pregnant women in a primary health center (PHC) versus two hospitals.  We collected rectal swab samples from 200 pregnant women who visited a PHC or were admitted to two hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia from July to October 2018. The ESBL-E strains were isolated from the samples and phenotypically and genotypically analyzed.  ESBL-E strains were isolated from 25 (24.8%) pregnant women who visited the PHC and 49 (49.5%) pregnant women who were admitted to the hospitals. The rate of ESBL-E carriage of pregnant women in the hospitals was significantly higher than that in the PHC. Among the 74 isolated ESBL-E strains, ESBL-EC was most frequently isolated (62 strains), followed by ESBL-KP (12 strains).

2,"Predominance of genetically diverse ESBL Escherichia coli identified in resistance mapping of Vembanad Lake, the largest fresh-cum-brackishwater lake of India. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) burden in Escherichia coli along the 90 km stretch of Vembanad Lake, Kerala, India, was assessed. Seventy-seven percent of water samples drawn from 35 different stations of the lake harbored E. coli. Antibiotic susceptibility test performed on 116 E. coli isolates revealed resistance to ≥ one antibiotic with 39 AMR profiles in 81%, multidrug resistance in 30%, and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers in 32%. Of all the 15 antibiotics tested, the probability of isolating cefotaxime-resistant E. coli was the highest (P ≤ 0.05) in the lake. Genetically diverse ESBL types, namely bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, and bla, were identified in the lake. This is probably the first report in India for the presence of bla (bla) in the Vembanad Lake. ST11439 and single and double loci variants of ST443 and ST4533 were identified in multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Inc plasmids (B/O, F, W, I1, FIIA, HI1, P-1α, K/B, and N) identified in the lake evidences the resistance transmission potential of the E. coli isolated from the lake. Molecular typing (ERIC-PCR, MLST, and PBRT) delineated diverse E. coli, both between and within the sampling stations. Low multiple antibiotic resistance index (average MAR< 0.2) indicates a lower risk of the lake to the human population, but the occurrence of genetically diverse ESBL E. coli in the Vembanad Lake signals health hazards and necessitates pragmatic control measures."

2,"Dynamics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing  colonization in long-term carriers following travel abroad. Travel to tropical regions is associated with high risk of acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing  (ESBL-E) that are typically cleared in less than 3 months following return. The conditions leading to persistent carriage that exceeds 3 months in some travellers require investigation. Whole-genome sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) was performed on the 82 ESBL-E isolates detected upon return and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months later from the stools of 11 long-term (>3 months) ESBL-E carriers following travel abroad. One to five different ESBL  strains were detected per traveller upon return, and this diminished to one after 3 months. Long-term carriage was due to the presence of the same ESBL  strain, for more than 3 months, in 9 out of 11 travellers, belonging to epidemic sequence type complexes (STc 10, 14, 38, 69, 131 and 648). The mean carriage duration of strains belonging to phylogroups B2/D/F, associated with extra-intestinal virulence, was higher than that for commensal-associated A/B1/E phylogroups (3.5 vs 0.5 months, =0.021). Genes encoding iron capture systems (), toxins (, ), adhesins (, , ) and colicin () were more often present in persistent strains than in transient ones. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in persistent strains showed a maximum divergence of eight SNPs over 12 months without signs of adaptation. Genomic plasticity was observed during the follow-up with the loss or gain of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, integrons and/or transposons that may contain resistance genes at different points in the follow-up. Long-term colonization of ESBL-E following travel is primarily due to the acquisition of  strains belonging to epidemic clones and harbouring 'virulence genes', allowing good adaptation to the intestinal microbiota."

Overall, 31 (70.5%) of the ESBL-E isolates carried only -like genes, and the genes were found to be  ( = 30, 68.2%) or  ( = 1, 2.3%). Eleven strains (25%) had -like genes, mostly  ( = 10, 22.7%) and unique  ( = 1, 2.3%). One isolate possessed both  and  genes, and another one produced TEM-12 ESBL. MLST analysis revealed  sequence type (ST) 131 and ST361, and  ST16, ST307, and ST437. Among  isolates, the B2 phylogenetic group was predominant. Most of the strains showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, and susceptibility to aminoglycosides and carbapenems. Patients with solid cancer and ESBL-E infections require special management since they are a population with a high threat of antibiotic-resistant infections.

2,"Identity of  Carrying Plasmids in Sequential ESBL- Isolates from Patients with Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections. Plasmid-mediated multidrug resistance in  is becoming increasingly prevalent. Considering this global threat to human health, it is important to understand how plasmid-mediated resistance spreads. From a cohort of 123 patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) due to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  (ESBL ), only five events with a change of ESBL  strain between RUTI episodes were identified. Their  encoding plasmids were compared within each pair of isolates using optical DNA mapping (ODM) and PCR-based replicon typing. Despite similar  genes and replicon types, ODM detected only one case with identical plasmids in the sequential ESBL  strains, indicating that plasmid transfer could have occurred. For comparison, plasmids from seven patients with the same ESBL  strain reoccurring in both episodes were analyzed. These plasmids (encoding , , and ) were unaltered for up to six months between recurrent infections. Thus, transmission of  plasmids appears to be a rare event during the course of RUTI. Despite the limited number ( = 23) of plasmids investigated, similar - plasmids in unrelated isolates from different patients were detected, suggesting that some successful plasmids could be associated with specific strains, or are more easily transmitted."
