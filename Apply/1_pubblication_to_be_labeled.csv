"Trends in prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolated from patients with community- and healthcare-associated bacteriuria: results from 2014 to 2020 in an urban safety-net healthcare system. The prevalence of infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) is increasing worldwide, but the setting in which this increase is occurring is not well defined. We compared trends and risk factors for ESBL-E. coli bacteriuria in community vs healthcare settings."
"Diversity of Plasmids and Genes Encoding Resistance to Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase in  from Different Animal Sources. Antimicrobial resistance associated with the spread of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes conferring resistance to third generation cephalosporins is increasing worldwide. However, data on the population of ESBL producing  in different animal sources and their antimicrobial characteristics are limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential reservoirs of ESBL-encoded genes in  isolated from swine, beef, dairy, and poultry collected from different regions of the United States using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Three hundred isolates were typed into different phylogroups, characterized by BOX AIR-1 PCR and tested for resistance to antimicrobials. Of the 300 isolates, 59.7% were resistant to sulfisoxazole, 49.3% to tetracycline, 32.3% to cephalothin, 22.3% to ampicillin, 20% to streptomycin, 16% to ticarcillin; resistance to the remaining 12 antimicrobials was less than 10%. Phylogroups A and B1 were most prevalent with A ( = 92, 30%) and B1 (87 = 29%). A total of nine  isolates were confirmed as ESBL producers by double-disk synergy testing and multidrug resistant (MDR) to at least three antimicrobial drug classes. Using WGS, significantly higher numbers of ESBL- were detected in swine and dairy manure than from any other animal sources, suggesting that these may be the primary animal sources for ESBL producing . These isolates carry plasmids, such as IncFIA(B), IncFII, IncX1, IncX4, IncQ1, CollRNAI, Col440I, and acquired ARGs (6)-Id, (3″)-Ib, A5, (3')-Ia, , , A, B, A1, 1, 2, B, A17. One of the  isolates from swine with ST 410 was resistant to nine antibiotics and carried more than 28 virulence factors, and this ST has been shown to belong to an international high-risk clone. Our data suggests that ESBL producing  are widely distributed in different animal sources, but swine and dairy cattle may be their main reservoir."
"Maternal Vaginal Colonization and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing Bacteria in Vietnamese Pregnant Women. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) resistance to commonly prescribed drugs is increasing in Vietnam. During pregnancy, ESBL-E may predispose women to reproductive tract infections and increases the risk for neonatal morbidity. Vaginal colonization and infections by  and  are seldom studied in Vietnam. In this study, we investigated ESBL-producing Enterobacterales in the birth canal of pregnant women. Between 2016 and 2020, vaginal swabs were collected from 3104 pregnant women (mean gestational age of 31 weeks) and inoculated onto MacConkey agar plates. Colonies were subjected to direct identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the VITEK-2 automated compact system and disk diffusion. ESBL production was determined phenotypically. ,  were identified in 30% (918/3104) of the vaginal swabs, with  being the most common (73%; 667/918). ESBL-production was detected in 47% (432/918) of Enterobacterales, with frequent multidrug-resistant phenotype. The overall prevalence of carbapenem resistance was low (8%). Over 20% of  spp. were carbapenem-resistant. Pregnant women had a high prevalence of colonization and may transmit ESBL-E to neonates at birth, an important risk factor to be considered. The high rate of ESBL-producers and carbapenem resistance in Enterobacterales in Vietnam emphasizes the need for consequent surveillance and access to molecular typing."
"Circulation of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing  of Pandemic Sequence Types 131, 648, and 410 Among Hospitalized Patients, Caregivers, and the Community in Rwanda. Multi-drug resistant (MDR), gram-negative , such as  () limit therapeutic options and increase morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs worldwide. They pose a serious burden on healthcare systems, especially in developing countries like Rwanda. Several studies have shown the effects caused by the global spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing . However, limited data is available on transmission dynamics of these pathogens and the mobile elements they carry in the context of clinical and community locations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we examined 120 ESBL-producing  strains from patients hospitalized in the University Teaching Hospital of Butare (Rwanda), their attending caregivers as well as associated community members and livestock. Based on whole-genome analysis, the genetic diversification and phylogenetics were assessed. Moreover, the content of carried plasmids was characterized and investigated for putative transmission among strains, and for their potential role as drivers for the spread of antibiotic resistance. We show that among the 30 different sequence types (ST) detected were the pandemic clonal lineages ST131, ST648 and ST410, which combine high-level antimicrobial resistance with virulence. In addition to the frequently found resistance genes   , (34), and , we identified  genes, which are required for curli fiber synthesis and thus biofilm formation. Numerous strains harbored multiple virulence-associated genes (VAGs) including  (P fimbriae adhesion cluster),  (type I fimbriae) and  (Chu heme uptake system). Furthermore, we found phylogenetic relationships among strains from patients and their caregivers or related community members and animals, which indicates transmission of pathogens. Also, we demonstrated the presence and potential transfer of identical/similar ESBL-plasmids in different strains from the Rwandan setting and when compared to an external plasmid. This study highlights the circulation of clinically relevant, pathogenic ESBL-producing  among patients, caregivers and the community in Rwanda. Combining antimicrobial resistance with virulence in addition to the putative exchange of mobile genetic elements among bacterial pathogens poses a significant risk around the world."

"Detection of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing and Carbapenem-Resistant Bacteria from Mink Feces and Feed in the United States. Antibiotic-resistant infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases are increasing worldwide. Bacteria resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and last resort carbapenems have been reported from food animals and their environments. Other concentrated nonfood-producing animals such as mink farming can be a reservoir of bacteria resistant to these critically important antibiotics. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria and carbapenem-resistant (CR) bacteria from mink fecal ( = 42) and feed ( = 8) samples obtained from a commercial mink farm in the United States. The most prevalent ESBL-producing bacteria identified from the fecal samples were  (93%),  (76%), and  species (88%).  (100%) and  (75%) were also the most prevalent ESBL-producing bacteria identified from feed samples. All ESBL  isolates were resistant to penicillin and most cephem beta-lactam antibiotics. Among the ESBL  isolates, co-resistance was observed to ciprofloxacin (33%) and gentamicin (28%) indicating multidrug resistance. ESBL  isolates predominantly carried  and  genes. Although all feed  isolates carried , all fecal  isolates carried . CR  species (7%),  (24%), and  (9.5%) were detected from fecal samples.  (37.5%) was the only CR bacteria detected from the feed samples. All CR isolates were polymerase chain reaction negative for the tested carbapenemases that are commonly reported, which may indicate intrinsic rather than acquired resistance. This study indicates that mink production can be a reservoir for bacteria resistant to the highest priority critically important antibiotics for human health."
"ESBL-Producing   Carrying CTX-M Genes Circulating among Livestock, Dogs, and Wild Mammals in Small-Scale Farms of Central Chile. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria of critical importance for global health such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing (ESBL)- have been detected in livestock, dogs, and wildlife worldwide. However, the dynamics of ESBL- between these animals remains poorly understood, particularly in small-scale farms of low and middle-income countries where contact between species can be frequent. We compared the prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL- among 332 livestock (207 cows, 15 pigs, 60 horses, 40 sheep, 6 goats, 4 chickens), 82 dogs, and wildlife including 131 European rabbits, 30 rodents, and 12 Andean foxes sharing territory in peri-urban localities of central Chile. The prevalence was lower in livestock (3.0%) and wildlife (0.5%) compared to dogs (24%). Among 47 ESBL- isolates recovered, CTX-M-group 1 was the main ESBL genotype identified, followed by CTX-M-groups 2, 9, 8, and 25. ERIC-PCR showed no cluster of  clones by either host species nor locality. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ESBL- among sheep, cattle, dogs, and rodents of Chile, confirming their fecal carriage among domestic and wild animals in small-scale farms. The high prevalence of ESBL- in dogs encourages further investigation on their role as potential reservoirs of this bacteria in agricultural settings."

Treatment options for urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms are limited other than carbapenem. Accordingly, clinicians should investigate alternative antimicrobial options for limited infection. This study was performed to assess the efficacy of single-dose amikacin and a 7-day oral regimen of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of acute cystitis caused by ESBL-producing  and ."
"Clonal CTX-M-15-Producing  ST-949 Are Present in German Surface Water. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacterial isolates are emerging within the last years. To understand this emergence, a thorough genome-based analysis of ESBL isolates from different sources (One Health approach) is needed. Among these, analysis of surface water is underrepresented. Therefore, we performed a genome-based analysis of ESBL-producing  isolates from surface water samples. Water samples were collected from eleven different surface water sites (lakes, river). ESBL-producing  were recovered from these samples using filters and chromogenic media. Whole-genome sequencing of ESBL-producing  was performed followed by determination of the multilocus sequence type (ST), ESBL-type, and virulence genes. Phylogenetic analysis was done using single nucleotide analysis. From all water samples taken, nineteen ESBL-producing  were recovered. All of them harbored an ESBL gene. Nine different multilocus STs were determined, among which ST-949 was the ST detected most frequently. Phylogenetic analysis of ST-949 isolates revealed that all those isolates were closely related. In addition, they harbored an identical chromosomal insertion of   , indicating a clonal relationship among these isolates. Genetic comparison with isolates from all over the world revealed that these isolates were closely related to human clinical isolates derived from New Zealand and Sweden. An ESBL-producing  ST-949 clone was detected in German surface waters. Its close relationship to human clinical isolates suggests its ability to colonize or even infect humans. Our findings reveal that water sources indeed may play a hitherto underreported role in spread of ESBL-producing isolates."
"Ultrasmall Ga-ICG nanoparticles based gallium ion/photodynamic synergistic therapy to eradicate biofilms and against drug-resistant bacterial liver abscess. Pyogenic liver abscess and keratitis are aggressive bacterial infections and the treatment has failed to eradicate bacteria in infectious sites completely owing to the currently severe drug resistance to existing antibiotics. Here, we report a simple and efficient one-step development of ultrasmall non-antibiotic nanoparticles (ICG-Ga NPs) containing clinically approved gallium (III) (Ga) and liver targeting indocyanine green (ICG) molecules to eradicate multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria thought the synergetic effect of photodynamic therapy and iron metabolism blocking. The ICG-Ga NPs induced photodynamic effect could destroy the bacterial membrane, further boost the endocytosis of Ga, then replace iron in bacteria cells to disrupt bacterial iron metabolism, and demonstrate the synergetic bacterial killing and biofilm disrupting effects. The ICG-Ga NPs show an excellent therapeutic effect against extended spectrum β-lactamases  (ESBL ) and significantly improve treatment outcomes in infected liver abscess and keratitis. Meanwhile, the ultrasmall size of ICG-Ga NPs could be cleared rapid via renal clearance route, guaranteeing the biocompatibility. The protective effect and good biocompatibility of ICG-Ga NPs will facilitate clinical treatment of bacteria infected diseases and enable the development of next-generation non-antibiotic antibacterial agents."
"Global prevalence and molecular characterization of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing- in dogs and cats - A scoping review and meta-analysis. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major threat to human and animal health. Part of the AMR dimension is the circulation of extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing- (ESBL-), which is now commonly reported among companion animals. However, the global perspective of the prevalence and population structure of ESBL- circulating in dogs and cats has not been estimated limiting our understanding of their role in the dissemination of ESBL-. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of ESBL- between dogs and cats and across countries through meta-analysis. We also performed a scoping review to summarize the current knowledge on ESBL genes and  clones circulating among companion animals. A total of 128 studies published in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 2020 were selected and contained information on prevalence and/or molecular characterization of ESBL genes and ESBL- clones. Our review shows an increase in the number of publications between 2000 and 2019, concentrated mainly in Europe. Prevalence varied across continents, ranging from 0.63% (Oceania) to 16.56% (Africa) in dogs and from 0% (Oceania) to 16.82% (Asia) in cats. Although there were twice as many studies reporting prevalence on dogs ( = 61) than on cats ( = 32), and only 9 studies focused exclusively on cats, our meta-analysis showed no difference in the global prevalence of ESBL- between dogs (6.87% [95% CI: 4.46-10.45%]) and cats (5.04% [95% CI: 2.42-10.22%]). A considerable diversity of ESBL genes ( = 60) and sequence types (ST) ( = 171) were recovered from companion animals. ESBL- encoded by CTX-M-15 (67.5%, 77/114) and SHV-12 (21.9%, 25/114), along with resistant strains of ST38 (22.7%, 15/66) and ST131 (50%, 33/66) were widespread and detected in all continents. While presence of ESBL- is widespread, the drivers influencing the observed ESBL- prevalence and the clinical relevance in veterinary medicine and public health along with economic impact of ESBL- infections among companion animals need to be further investigated."
"Analysis of Selection Methods to Develop Novel Phage Therapy Cocktails Against Antimicrobial Resistant Clinical Isolates of Bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem globally. The main bacterial organisms associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) associated sepsis are  and  along with  species. These all have AMR strains known as ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase), which are featured on the WHO priority pathogens list as ""critical"" for research. Bacteriophages (phages), as viruses that can infect and kill bacteria, could provide an effective tool to tackle these AMR strains. There is currently no ""gold standard"" for developing a phage cocktail. Here we describe a novel approach to develop an effective phage cocktail against a set of ESBL-producing  and  largely isolated from patients in United Kingdom hospitals. By comparing different measures of phage efficacy, we show which are the most robust, and suggest an efficient screening cascade that could be used to develop phage cocktails to target other AMR bacterial species. A target panel of 38 ESBL-producing clinical strains isolated from urine samples was collated and used to test phage efficacy. After an initial screening of 68 phages, six were identified and tested against these 38 strains to determine their clinical coverage and killing efficiency. To achieve this, we assessed four different methods to assess phage virulence across these bacterial isolates. These were the Direct Spot Test (DST), the Efficiency of Plating (EOP) assay, the planktonic killing assay (PKA) and the biofilm assay. The final ESBL cocktail of six phages could effectively kill 23/38 strains (61%), for  13/19 (68%) and for  10/19 (53%) based on the PKA data. The ESBL  collection had six isolates from the prevalent UTI-associated ST131 sequence type, five of which were targeted effectively by the final cocktail. Of the four methods used to assess phage virulence, the data suggests that PKAs are as effective as the much more time-consuming EOPs and data for the two assays correlates well. This suggests that planktonic killing is a good proxy to determine which phages should be used in a cocktail. This assay when combined with the virulence index also allows ""phage synergy"" to inform cocktail design."

"Early prediction models for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infection in emergency department: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis. Resistance in gram-negative bacteria has gained great importance in recent decades and one reason is the rapid increase of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria as a growing problem worldwide. The increasing proportion of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) infections acquired in the emergency community is a new feature of ESBLs epidemiology. Early recognition of patients with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infection is important in the emergency department. To mitigate the burden on the healthcare system, while also providing the best possible care for patients, early recognition of the infection is needed."

"Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing and multidrug-resistant  in street foods: a public health concern. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pattern and virulence genes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing  from foods of animal origin were evaluated. Based on combination disc method and ESBL E test, 42 of the 213  isolates were confirmed as ESBL producers where a high presence was observed in raw foods (60.62%), environmental samples (46.73%) and ready to eat foods (42.99%) of which 31(26.49%), 3(6.97%) and 7(15.21%) samples harbored ESBL , respectively. Higher contamination rates were observed in samples collected from meat vendors (54.36%), milk vendors (48.88%) and egg vendors (45.20%) of which 16.1%, 11.11% and 2.05%, respectively were ESBL . Among the 42 ESBL isolates, 85.71% (36/42) were multidrug-resistant. On polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, expression of beta-lactamase genes viz,  was noted in 69.04% (29/42) ESBL isolates,  in 66.66% (28/42) and  in 19.04% (8/42) isolates, while  was not detected in any of the isolates. Other AMR genes viz, , , , , , , , , , ,  were detected by PCR in 39, 28, 29, 3, 9, 5, 17, 11, 6, 6 and 33 isolates, respectively. None of the isolates harbored chloramphenicol () and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) () genes. However, 21 isolates were positive for class I integron (), 5 for EPEC () and 9 for ETEC () while none were carrying  or  genes. All ESBL producing isolates formed a single group when subjected to enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC PCR) genotyping. The presence of multidrug-resistant ESBL  in street foods of animal origin raises the issues of food safety and public health."

"Antimicrobial use and resistance in Escherichia coli from healthy food-producing animals in Guadeloupe. Selection pressure exerted by use of antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine is responsible for increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The objectives of this study were to better understand antimicrobial use in pigs, beef cattle, and poultry on farms on Guadeloupe, French West Indies, and to acquire data on AMR in Escherichia coli in these food-producing animals. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at 45 farms on Guadeloupe, and practical use of antimicrobials was documented in declarative interviews between March and July 2018. A total of 216 fecal samples were collected between January 2018 and May 2019, comprising 124 from pigs, 75 from beef cattle, and 17 from poultry litter. E. coli isolates were obtained for further testing by isolation and identification from field samples.

"Vertical Transmission of Extended-Spectrum, Beta-Lactamase-Producing  during Preterm Delivery: A Prospective Study. Maternal carriage and vertical transmission of extended-spectrum, beta-lactamase-producing  (ESBL-E), such as , hamper the treatment of infections, resulting in high morbidity.  is the most frequent cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) in preterm infants, where ESBL-E are more frequently isolated. In this prospective, case-controlled study, maternal rectovaginal ESBL-E colonization and vertical transmission to preterm infants were assessed in 160 women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM; 57.4%) or preterm labor (42.6%); additional cultures were obtained from the placenta, amnion, and umbilical cord during preterm labor. Maternal and neonatal ESBL-E-carriage rates were 17.5% and 12.9%, respectively, and the vertical-transmission rate was 50%. Maternal ESBL-E colonization among women with PPROM was 21.3%, and in women with premature labor it was 12.6%. No correlation was observed between maternal ESBL-E-colonization and previous hospitalization or antibiotic administration during pregnancy. However, a correlation was found between placental inflammation and maternal ESBL-E colonization ( = 0.007). ESBL-E-colonized infants were delivered at an earlier gestational age and were more likely to have complications. Thus, the high ESBL-E carriage rate in women with threatened preterm labor, without obvious risk factors for carriage, and a high vertical transmission rate, combined with a correlation between placental inflammation and ESBL-E carriage, support maternal-neonatal ESBL-E-colonization surveillance and active measures to prevent ESBL-E-related EOS."
"Navigating treatment approaches for presumed ESBL-producing infections. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) remain a significant global threat. In several regions of the world, ESBLs are produced by over half of  or  infections, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Though it is accepted that carbapenems are effective for the treatment of invasive ESBL-E infections, controversy remains as to whether carbapenem alternatives can be considered in select cases. Indiscriminate carbapenem use for the treatment of ESBL-E infections will likely further the international antimicrobial resistance crisis, underscoring the importance of investigating the role of non-carbapenem options. In this issue of , we present a PRO/CON debate exploring whether carbapenems are necessary for all infections caused by ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacterales."

"Transmission Chains of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae at the Companion Animal Veterinary Clinic-Household Interface. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) among animals and humans are a public health threat. This study analyzed the occurrence of ESBL-E in a high-risk environment in a companion animal clinic and two animal patients' households. In an intensive care unit (ICU), rectal swabs from 74 dogs and cats, 74 hand swabs from staff and 298 swabs from surfaces were analyzed for ESBL-E. Seventeen hospitalized patients (23%) and ten (3%) surfaces in the ICU tested ESBL-E positive. Transmission chains for  ST307  and  ST38 , ST88  and ST224  were observed over extended periods of time (14 to 30 days) with similar strains isolated from patients and the clinical environment. After discharge, two colonized dogs (dogs 7 and 12) and their household contacts were resampled. Dog 7 tested repeatedly positive for 77 days, dog 12 tested negative; six (24%) surfaces in the household of the persistently colonized dog tested ESBL-E positive. The owner of dog 7 and one of the owners of dog 12 were colonized. Based on whole genome sequencing, isolates from the owners, their dogs and other ICU patients belonged to the same clusters, highlighting the public health importance of ESBL-E in companion animal clinics."

"Characteristics of ESBL-Producing Enterobacterales Colonizing the Gastrointestinal Tract in Patients Admitted to the Oncological Hospital. We analyzed the prevalence and genetic characteristics of the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacterales isolated from adult patients hospitalized in the oncological center in 2019. Out of 9372 patients admitted to the hospital, 1373 had been in various medical facilities during the last year, which was an indication to perform a screening test for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonizing their gastrointestinal tract. In eighty-three patients (6.1%), 85 ESBL producers were detected. These isolates included the following: Escherichia coli (n = 67; 78.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 14; 16.5%), Enterobacter cloacae cplx (n = 3; 3.5%), and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1; 1.2%). CTX-M-1-like enzymes were the most common ESBLs (n = 67; 78.8%). Two K. pneumoniae isolates (2/85; 2.4%) additionally produced New Delhi-metallo-β-lactamases (NDM). All isolates, except for K. oxytoca, were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and demonstrated high genetic diversity. The most prevalent phylogroups of E. coli were B2 group (n = 30; 44.8%), followed by A group (n = 25; 37.3%). These observations have motivated us to investigate the link between ESBL-E colonization and infection among patients with solid tumors."

"Successful de-escalation antibiotic therapy using cephamycins for sepsis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia: A sequential 25-case series. Carbapenems are frequently used to treat infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), but carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria are a clinical concern. Although cephamycins (cefmetazole; CMZ) have been shown to be effective against mild cases of ESBL-E infection, data on their use for severe ESBL-E infections with sepsis or septic shock remain scarce. Herein, we discuss a de-escalation therapy to CMZ that could be used after empiric antibiotic therapy in ICU patients with sepsis or septic shock caused by ESBL-E bacteremia. A sequence of 25 cases diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock caused by ESBL-E bacteria was evaluated. The attending infectious disease specialist physicians selected the antibiotics and decided the de-escalation timing. The median SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) and APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) severity scores were 8 and 30; the rate of septic shock was 60%. Infections originated most frequently with urinary tract infection (UTI) (56%) and  (85%). Eleven patients were de-escalated to CMZ after vital signs were stable, and all survived. No patients died of UTI regardless of with or without de-escalation. The median timing of de-escalation antibiotic therapy after admission was 4 days (range, 3-6 days). At the time of de-escalation, the median SOFA score fell from 8 to 5, the median APACHE II score from 28 to 22, and the rate of septic shock from 55% to 0%. We conclude that for sepsis in UTI caused by ESBL-E bacteremia, de-escalation therapy from broad-spectrum antibiotics to CMZ is a potential treatment option when vital signs are stable."
"Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  and  urinary tract infections. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infections (UTIs) is increasing worldwide. We investigated the prevalence, clinical findings, impact and risk factors of ESBL E. coli/K. pneumoniae UTI through a retrospective review of the medical records of children with UTI aged <15 years admitted to Prince of Songkla University Hospital, Thailand over 10 years (2004-2013). Thirty-seven boys and 46 girls had ESBL-positive isolates in 102 UTI episodes, compared with 85 boys and 103 girls with non-ESBL isolates in 222 UTI episodes. The age of presentation and gender were not significantly different between the two groups. The prevalence of ESBL rose between 2004 and 2008 before plateauing at around 30-40% per year, with a significant difference between first and recurrent UTI episodes of 27.3% and 46.5%, respectively (P = 0.003). Fever prior to UTI diagnosis was found in 78.4% of episodes in the non-ESBL group and 61.8% of episodes in the ESBL group (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis indicated that children without fever (odds ratio (OR) 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-3.74) and those with recurrent UTI (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.37-5.19) were more likely to yield ESBL on culture. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract were not linked to the presence of ESBL UTI. In conclusion, ESBL producers represented one-third of E. coli/K. pneumoniae UTI episodes but neither clinical condition nor imaging studies were predictive of ESBL infections. Recurrent UTI was the sole independent risk factor identified."
"Investigating the relationship between extended spectrum β-lactamase producing  in the environment and food chains with the presence of this infection in people suspected of septicemia: Using the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Among antibiotic resistance cases, resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is a major concern for the treatment of microbial infections. Furthermore, the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)  in environment, food, and human resources of Iran has increased over the past few years. This study aimed to predict the relationship between the prevalence of ESBL  in the environment and the food chains with the presence of this infection in people suspected of septicemia using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis model."
"The global prevalence and trend of human intestinal carriage of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in the community.

"Extended spectrum β lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae shedding by race horses in Ontario, Canada. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, molecular epidemiology and prevalence factors for Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) shedding by race horses. A cross-sectional study was performed involving fecal samples collected from 169 Thoroughbred horses that were housed at a large racing facility in Ontario, Canada. Samples were enriched, plated on selective plates, sub-cultured to obtain pure cultures and ESBL production was confirmed. Bacterial species were identified and antibiotic susceptibility profiles were assessed. E. coli sequence types (ST) and ESBL genes were determined using multilocus sequence type (MLST) and sequencing. Whole genome sequencing was performed to isolates harboring CTX-M-1 gene. Medical records were reviewed and associations were investigated."
"Hygiene management in newborn individually housed dairy calves focusing on housing and feeding practices. In calf rearing, the first weeks of life are critical and associated with the highest mortality due to enteric and respiratory diseases. A well-implemented hygiene management can help to protect calves' health preventively by reducing the load of pathogenic bacteria and interrupting infection chains. The aim of this study was to identify deficiencies in hygiene management of individually housed dairy calves by surveying current practice and examining feeding and housing equipment with different hygiene indicators. On 11 farms, different locations in 2 pens or hutches for individual calf rearing prepared for restocking and 2 feeding buckets per farm, including the inner and outer surfaces of artificial teats, were visually scored for cleanliness and sampled with swabs (housing equipment: n = 167; feeding equipment: n = 120). The sanitation of floors was tested with sock samples (n = 41). A total of 328 samples were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and protein residues, aerobic total viable count (TVC), total coliform count (TCC), Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL), and Salmonella spp. After evaluation of these results, the farmers were informed about the findings and trained on improvement in hygiene management personally. The sampling was repeated after 1 year to detect possible changes in hygiene management. The highest bacterial loads (TVC, TCC, and E. coli) were observed in feeding equipment, especially the inner teat of milk feeding buckets. Environmental samples, primarily the sidewalls and back walls of tested pens and hutches, exhibited the lowest bacterial counts and ATP and protein residues. All samples were negative for MRSA and Salmonella spp. In 10.5% of all samples, ESBL was detected, and in 6.8%, ESBL E. coli was detected, predominately in sock samples, followed by feeding equipment samples. Training in hygiene management showed only limited effects. In conclusion, there is still great potential to improve the implementation of hygiene measures in individual calf housing. In particular, more attention should be paid to the cleaning of feeding buckets and artificial teats, as this is a simple means of interrupting the possible spread of pathogens among calves."
"Occurrence and Characteristics of Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase-Producing  from Dairy Cattle, Milk, and Farm Environments in Peninsular Malaysia. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and resistant bacteria do not recognize animal, human, or geographic boundaries. Addressing this threat requires a multidisciplinary approach involving human, animal, and environmental health (One Health) sectors. This is because antimicrobial agents used in veterinary medicine have been reported to be the same or similar to those in human medicine use. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)  is a growing public health problem worldwide, and the agri-food industry is increasingly becoming a source of clinically important ESBL bacteria. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of ESBL-producing  from dairy cattle, milk, and the farm environment.  isolates were identified by their 16sRNA, and their ESBL production was confirmed using ESBL-CHROMagar media and the double disk diffusion method. Genotypes of ESBL producers were characterized using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay. It was found that 18 (4.8%) of the total samples were positive for ESBL-producing . Of these, 66.7% were from milk, and 27.8% and 5.5% were from the farm environment and faecal samples, respectively. Predominant ESBL genotypes identified were a combination of both TEM and CTX-M in eight out of 18 (44.4%) isolates. Four (22.2%) isolates produced the CTX-M gene, two (11.1%) isolates produced the TEM gene, and four (22.2%) remaining isolates produced the ESBL genes other than TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and OXA. The SHV and OXA gene were not detected in all 18 isolates. In all, there were four profiles of genetic similarity. The occurrence of these genotypes in indicator organisms from dairy cattle, milk, and the farm environment further re-enforced the potential of food-animals as sources of ESBL-producing  infection in humans via the food chain. Thus, there is the need for the adoption of a tripartite One Health approach in surveillance and monitoring to control antimicrobial resistance."

"The importance of using whole genome sequencing and extended spectrum beta-lactamase selective media when monitoring antimicrobial resistance. To tackle the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance programmes are in place within Europe applying phenotypic methods, but there are plans for implementing whole genome sequencing (WGS). We tested the benefits of WGS using Escherichia coli collected from pig surveillance performed between 2013 to 2017. WGS was performed on 498 E. coli producing ESBL and AmpC enzymes, recovered from pig caeca on MacConkey + cefotaxime (McC + CTX) agar, as recommended by the European Commission, or ESBL agar, used additionally by United Kingdom. Our results indicated WGS was extremely useful for monitoring trends for specific ESBL genes, as well as a plethora of AMR genotypes, helping to establish their prevalence and co-linkage to certain plasmids. Recovery of isolates with multi-drug resistance (MDR) genotypes was lower from McC + CTX than ESBL agar. The most widespread ESBL genes belonged to the bla family. bla dominated all years, and was common in two highly stable IncI1 MDR plasmids harbouring (bla,sul2, tetA) or (bla, aadA5, sul2, dfrA17), in isolates which were phylogenetically dissimilar, suggesting plasmid transmission. Therefore, WGS provided a wealth of data on prevalence of AMR genotypes and plasmid persistence absent from phenotypic data and, also, demonstrated the importance of culture media for detecting ESBL E. coli."

"Fecal carriage and factors associated with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae among pregnant women at the tertiary referral hospital, Tanzania. Infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are increasing worldwide. Evidence indicates that fecal carriage of ESBL-E in pregnancy predisposes women to potential life-threatening urinary tract infections and subsequently increasing the risk of neonatal infections. There is limited data regarding fecal carriage of ESBL-E and associated factors among pregnant women in Tanzania. We aimed to address the gap by determining the proportion of pregnant women with ESBL-E fecal carriage and identify the related factors."
"Antimicrobial resistant and enteropathogenic bacteria in 'filth flies': a cross-sectional study from Nigeria. 'Filth flies' facilitate the dispersal of pathogens between animals and humans. The objective was to study the intestinal colonization with antimicrobial resistant and enteropathogenic bacteria in 'filth flies' from Nigeria. Flies from Southern Nigeria were screened for extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Campylobacter sp. and Yersinia enterocolitica by culture. ESBL-E were tested for bla, bla and bla; S. aureus was screened for enterotoxins. Spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was done for S. aureus and MLST for Escherichia coli. Of 2,000 flies, 400 were randomly collected for species identification. The most common species were Musca domestica (44.8%, 179/400), Chrysomya putoria (21.6%, 85/400) and Musca sorbens (18.8%, 75/400). Flies were colonized with S. aureus (13.8%, 275/2,000) and ESBL-E (0.8%, 16/2,000). No other enteropathogenic bacteria were detected. The enterotoxin sei was most common (26%, 70/275) in S. aureus, followed by sea (12%, n = 32/275). Four S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant (mecA positive, t674 and t5305, ST15). The bla (n = 16) was the most prevalent ESBL subtype, followed by bla (n = 8). 'Filth flies' can carry antimicrobial resistant bacteria in Nigeria. Enterotoxin-positive S. aureus might be the main reason for food poisoning by 'filth flies' in the study area."

"In vitro immune responses of bovine mammary epithelial cells induced by Escherichia coli, with multidrug resistant extended-spectrum β-lactamase, isolated from mastitic milk. Bovine mastitis is an inflammatory condition of mammary glands causing huge economic losses for dairy industries. Infection with extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing sequence types (ST) 410-Escherichia coli (ESBL-ST410 E. coli) is considered a leading cause of bovine mastitis in China. However, pathogenic effects of these strains in an in vitro model, e.g. bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs), are unknown. Therefore, our objectives were to explore pathogenesis (adhesion and invasion, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis) of ESBL-E. coli (highly prevalent in bovine mastitis) in bMECs. Non-pathogenic E. coli DH5α and a prototypical E. coli P4 were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. The bMECs were infected with our isolated ST410 strains, plus DH5α and P4, with assessment of the following end points: adhesive and invasive capabilities; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities; inflammatory responses, including concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α; oxidative stress including intracellular reactive oxygen species production, malondialdehyde concentrations, activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase; and apoptosis. All ST410 strains had greater adhesive and invasive capabilities and increased LDH release, with varying degrees of inflammatory responses, oxidative stress and apoptosis compared to blank and DH5α groups, similar to P4-infected bMECs. In particular, ST410(4) was more likely than the other 3 isolates to adhere to and invade bMECs and increase LDH activities, cytokine release, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Thus, ST410 isolates had pathogenic manifestations of adhesive and invasive capabilities; furthermore, they induced inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in bMECs. Finally, ST410(4) was the most pathogenic strain."

"Genetic characterization of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from wastewater and river water in Tunisia: predominance of CTX-M-15 and high genetic diversity. Aquatic environments are crucial hotspots for the dissemination of antibiotic resistant microorganisms and resistance genes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence and the genetic characterization of cefotaxime-resistant (CTX) Enterobacteriaceae at a Tunisian semi-industrial pilot plant with biological treatment (WWPP) and its receiving river (Rouriche River, downstream from WWPP) located in Tunis City, during 2017-2018. We collected 105 and 15 water samples from the WWPP and the Rouriche River, respectively. Samples were screened to recover ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) and isolates were characterized for phenotype/genotype of antimicrobial resistance, integrons, plasmid types and molecular typing (multilocus sequence typing, MLST). Among 120 water samples, 33 and 4 contained ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. Most isolates were multidrug resistant and produced CTX-M-15 (28 isolates), CTX-M-1 (4 isolates), CTX-M-55 (2 isolates), CTX-M-27 (one isolate), SHV-12 (one isolate) and VEB beta-lactamases (one isolate). All K. pneumoniae were CTX-M-15-positive. Four colistin-resistant isolates were found (MIC 4-8 μg/ml), but they were negative for the mcr genes tested. Class 1 integrons were detected in 21/25 trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant isolates, and nine of them carried the gene cassette arrays: aadA2 + dfrA12 (n = 4), aadA1 + dfrA15 (n = 2), aadA5 + dfrA17 (n = 2) and aadA1/2 (n = 1). The IncP and IncFIB plasmids were found in 30 and 16 isolates, respectively. Genetic lineages detected were as follows: E. coli (ST48-ST10 Cplx, ST2499, ST906, ST2973 and ST2142); K. pneumoniae: (ST1540 and ST661). Our findings show a high rate of CTX-M-15 and high genetic diversity of ESBL-E isolates from WWPP and receiving river water."
"Antimicrobial Resistance in Wildlife in Guadeloupe (French West Indies): Distribution of a Single  /IncI1/ST3 Plasmid Among Humans and Wild Animals. Limited data are available on the contribution of wildlife to the spread of antibacterial resistance. We determined the prevalence of resistance to antibiotics in  isolates collected from wild animals in 2013 and 2014 and the genetic basis for resistance to third-generation cephalosporin in Guadeloupe. We recovered 52 antibiotic-resistant (AR)  strains from 48 of the 884 (5.4%) wild animals tested (46 iguanas, 181 birds, 289 anoles, and 368 rodents at 163 sampling sites). Rodents had higher rates of carriage ( = 38, 10.3%) than reptiles and birds (2.4% and 1.1%, respectively,  < 0.001). A significant association ( < 0.001) was found between the degree of anthropization and the frequency of AR  carriage for all species. The carriage rate of ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant isolates was 0.7% (6/884) and 1.5% (13/884), respectively. Most (65.4%) AR  were multi-drug resistant, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  was low ( = 7, 0.8%) in all species. Eight ESBL-producing  were recovered, two genetically unrelated isolates being found in one bird. These isolates and 20 human invasive ESBL  isolates collected in Guadeloupe during the same period were investigated by whole genome sequencing.   was the only ESBL gene shared by three animal classes (humans,  = 2; birds,  = 2; rodents,  = 2). The   gene and most of the antimicrobial resistance genes were present in a large conjugative IncI1 plasmid that was highly similar (>99% nucleotide identity) to ESBL-carrying plasmids found in several countries in Europe and in Australia. Although the prevalence of ESBL-producing  isolates was very low in wild animals, it is of concern that the well-conserved IncI1 plasmid-carrying   is widespread and occurs in various  strains from animals and humans."
"Selenomethionine Suppressed TLR4/NF-κB Pathway by Activating Selenoprotein S to Alleviate ESBL -Induced Inflammation in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells and Macrophages. Inflammation is the hallmark of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing -induced bovine mastitis. Organic selenium can activate pivotal proteins in immune responses and regulate the immune system. The present study aimed to investigate whether selenomethionine (SeMet) attenuates ESBL -induced inflammation in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) and macrophages. Cells were treated with 0, 5/10, 10/20, 20/40, or 40/60 μM SeMet for 12 h and/or inoculated with ESBL [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 5] for 4/6 h, respectively. We assessed inflammatory responses, including selenoprotein S (SeS), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Ikappa-B (IκB), phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. Treatment with 40/60 μM SeMet promoted cell viability and inhibited LDH activities in both bMECs and macrophages. Inoculation with ESBL- reduced cell viability, which was attenuated by SeMet treatment in bMECs and macrophages. SeMet increased ESBL -induced downregulation of SeS and decreased LDH activities, TLR4, IκB, phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536), IL-1β, and TNF-α protein expressions in bMECs and macrophages. In addition, knockdown of SeS promoted protein expression of TLR4-mediated nuclear factor-kappa (NF-κB) pathway and BAY 11-708 inhibited TNF-α and IL-1β protein levels in bMECs and macrophages after ESBL- treatment. Moreover, ESBL- inoculation increased monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL-3), and CCL-5 mRNA expressions in bMECs. In conclusion, ESBL- induced expression of MCP-1, CCL-3, and CCL-5 in bMECs and then recruited and activated macrophages, whereas SeMet attenuated ESBL -induced inflammation through activated SeS-mediated TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in bMECs and macrophages."
"Antimicrobial Susceptibility of  and ESBL-Producing  Diffusion in Conventional, Organic and Antibiotic-Free Meat Chickens at Slaughter. As a result of public health concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance in animal-based food products, conventional poultry companies have turned to 'raised without antibiotics' (ABF) and organic farming systems. In this work, we evaluated the influence of rearing systems on antimicrobial susceptibility in  and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESLB)  diffusion in conventional (C), organic (O) and antibiotic free (ABF) chicken samples collected from cloacal swabs and skin samples in slaughterhouse. The  isolates from conventional (135), antibiotic-free (131) and organic (140) samples were submitted to the Kirby-Bauer method and ESBL  were analyzed by the microdilution test. Conventional samples showed the highest number of strains resistant to ampicillin (89.6%;  < 0.01), cefotaxime (43.7%;  < 0.01), nalidixic acid (57.8%;  < 0.01), ciprofloxacin (44.4%;  < 0.001), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (62.2%;  < 0.01), with patterns of multi-resistance to three (35.1%) and to four antimicrobials (31.3%), whereas most of the  isolated from antibiotic-free and organic chicken samples revealed a co-resistance pattern (29.2% and 39%, respectively). The highest number of ESBL  was observed in conventional, in both cloacal and skin samples and the lowest in organic ( < 0.001). Our results are consistent with the effect of conventional farming practices on  antimicrobial resistance and ESBL  number, due to the use of antimicrobials and close contact with litter for most of the production cycle."

"Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing  in Drinking Water Samples From a Forcibly Displaced, Densely Populated Community Setting in Bangladesh.  Community-acquired infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing  are rising worldwide, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, especially where poor sanitation and inadequate hygienic practices are very common.  This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and characterization of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and ESBL-producing  in drinking water samples collected from Rohingya camps, Bangladesh.  A total of 384  isolates were analyzed in this study, of which 203 were from household or point-of-use (POU) water samples, and 181 were from source water samples. The isolates were tested for virulence genes, ESBL-producing genes, antimicrobial susceptibility by VITEK 2 assay, plasmid profiling, and conjugal transfer of AMR genes.  Of the 384  isolates tested, 17% (66/384) were found to be ESBL producers. The abundance of ESBL-producers in source water contaminated with  was observed to be 14% (27/181), whereas, 19% (39/203) ESBL producers was found in household POU water samples contaminated with . We detected 71% (47/66) ESBL to be MDR. Among these 47 MDR isolates, 20 were resistant to three classes, and 27 were resistant to four different classes of antibiotics. Sixty-four percent (42/66) of the ESBL producing  carried 1 to 7 plasmids ranging from 1 to 103 MDa. Only large plasmids with antibiotic resistance properties were found transferrable via conjugation. Moreover, around 7% (29/384) of  isolates harbored at least one of 10 virulence factors belonging to different  pathotypes.  The findings of this study suggest that the drinking water samples analyzed herein could serve as an important source for exposure and dissemination of MDR, ESBL-producing and pathogenic  lineages, which therewith pose a health risk to the displaced Rohingya people residing in the densely populated camps of Bangladesh."

"Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase-Producing  and  from Broiler Liver in the Center of Algeria, with Detection of CTX-M-55 and B2/ST131-CTX-M-15 in . This study aimed to determine the prevalence and diversity of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and multidrug-resistant (MDR)  and  isolates from 136 broiler livers randomly purchased in 136 retail markets in Djelfa (Algeria). Isolation was performed on Hektoen agar and bacterial identification was carried out by API20E system and Maldi-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry). Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. Detection of ESBLs and other resistance and integron genes, phylogenetic grouping, and molecular typing was performed by PCR and sequencing. Seventy-eight isolates (one per positive sample) were recovered: 73  and 5 . Among , 86.3% of isolates were MDR. ESBL activity was revealed in eight  and five e isolates (rates of 5.9% and 3.7% in analyzed samples, respectively). ESBL genes detected among  were as follows (number of isolates):  (3),  (3),  (1), and  (1); all ESBL-producing  isolates carried the  gene. ESBL-producing  isolates were assigned to lineages (phylogroup/sequence type and number of isolates in parenthesis): A/ST48 (1), B1/ST6448 (1), B1/ST5087 (3), B1/ST23 (1), and B2/ST131 (two   isolates).  isolates were ascribed to sequence types ST2010 and ST3483. Regarding the 65 non-ESBL  isolates, the most observed resistance genes were as follows: (A) (75%),  (57.1%), and  (43.5%). Class1 integrons were revealed in seven non-ESBL  isolates (10.7%) and two gene-cassette arrays were identified: 1 and 11. Our study provides evidence that broiler-derived food from Center of Algeria constitutes a source of ESBL and/or MDR-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with detection of relevant ESBL genes and epidemic clones."
"Implementation of contact isolation strategy for the containment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase carriers in a University Hospital positively affects the epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. The lack of consensus of control measures to prevent extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) transmission in the hospital setting is of great concern. We describe the prevalence and species distribution of ESBL-E and carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales (CPE) in patients admitted in a tertiary Hospital during an active surveillance screening program for detecting ESBL-E carriers and reducing the ESBL-E transmission (R-GNOSIS Project)."
"Differential Trends in Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing  Infections in Four Health Care Facilities in a Single Metropolitan Area: A Retrospective Analysis.  Prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing  (ESBL-) is increasing worldwide, but greatly varies geographically. We compared the prevalence of ESBL- infections at four distinct health care facilities in San Francisco, California.  Antimicrobial susceptibility reports were obtained for  isolates from (1) a county hospital, (2) a public skilled nursing facility, (3) a university hospital, and (4) a Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. We compared change in frequency of ESBL- and antimicrobial resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole between 2012 and 2018.  From 2012 to 2018, frequency of ESBL- increased in urine and nonurine isolates from the county hospital (urine: 1.1% per year, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-1.6,  < 0.01; nonurine: 1.9% per year, 95% CI: 0.9-2.9,  < 0.01) and in urine isolates from the VA hospital (0.9% per year, 95% CI: 0.3-1.4,  < 0.01). The frequency of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance fluctuated in all facilities.  At the skilled nursing facility, the prevalence of ESBL- was highest, but remained stable over time, while the prevalence of ESBL- increased among urine and nonurine isolates at the county hospital and urine isolates at the VA hospital. The temporal trend of ESBL- infections, even within one city, varied by health care facility."

"Influence of zinc on CTX-M-1 β-lactamase expression in Escherichia coli. Zinc oxide is used to prevent post-weaning diarrhoea in pigs as an alternative to antimicrobial growth promoters. This study aims to determine if the use of zinc oxide selects for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and affects the expression of bla in E. coli."
"Phylogenetic Characterization and Multilocus Sequence Typing of Extended-Spectrum Beta Lactamase-Producing  from Food-Producing Animals, Beef, and Humans in Southwest Nigeria. Multidrug-resistant extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing  strains are emerging globally in both humans and animals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and ESBL screening were performed on pure cultures of 216  isolates from human and animal fecal samples as well as beef. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for the detection of resistance genes. Representative isolates of ESBL-producing  were randomly selected for multilocus sequence typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Sixty of the isolates were identified as ESBL producers, and seven resistance genes were amplified in them:  (61.7%),  (51.7%),  (43.3%),  (38.3%),  (33.3%),  (21.7%), and  (11.7%); they were classified into four phylogroups: A (25%), B1 (45%), B2 (20%), and D (10%). Thirty of these isolates were clustered into 10 sequence types with ST131 being mostly prevalent. Six PFGE types were discovered, each of which was shared by isolates from different subjects and had the same phylogroups and resistance gene profiles. There was a dissemination of PFGE types across various groups among humans, animals, and beef. This underlines the fact that the spread of ESBL  could be from humans to animals, from animals to humans, as well as across animal species."
"The Gut of Healthy Infants in the Community as a Reservoir of ESBL and Carbapenemase-Producing Bacteria. The recent rapid rise of multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDR-E) is threatening the treatment of common infectious diseases. Infections with such strains lead to increased mortality and morbidity. Using a cross-sectional study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of gut colonization with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae among healthy infants born in Pakistan, a setting with high incidence of MDR-E infections. Stool samples were collected from 104 healthy infants between the ages of 5 and 7 months. Enterobacteriaceae isolates were screened for resistance against several antimicrobial classes. Presence of ESBL and carbapenemase genes was determined using multiplex PCR. Sequence types were assigned to individual strains by multi-locus sequence typing. Phylogenetic analysis of Escherichia coli was done using the triplex PCR method. Forty-three percent of the infants were positive for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, the majority of which were E. coli. We identified several different ESBL E. coli sequence types most of which belonged to the phylogenetic group B2 (23%) or D (73%). The widespread colonization of infants in a developing country with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is concerning. The multiple sequence types and reported non-human sources support that multiple non-epidemic MDR lineages are circulating in Pakistan with healthy infants as a common reservoir."
"Potential probiotic of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the intestinal tracts of pigs and feces of dogs with antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has become a serious problem in animals and public. The objective of this study was to identify and isolate lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains from the intestinal tracts of pigs and feces of dogs and then characterize them as potential probiotics with antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. In a preliminary isolation screening, 45 of 1167 isolated LAB strains were found to have anti-S. aureus ATCC 27,735 activity. Using 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequences, five of these isolates were further identified as Lactobacillus animalis 30a-2, Lactobacillus reuteri 4-12E, Weissella cibaria C34, Lactococcus lactis 5-12H, and Lactococcus lactis 6-3H. Antimicrobial substance assays suggest that the L. lactis 5-12H, L. lactis 6-3H, L. animalis 30a-2, L. reuteri 4-12E, and W. cibaria C34 strains might produce bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide (HO) as antimicrobial substances. The L. animalis 30a-2 and W. cibaria C34 strains were further characterized for probiotic properties and shown to have high acid and bile salt tolerance. Additionally, they have broad antimicrobial spectra, and can significantly repress the growth of all of the tested strains of MRSA isolates, some MDRAB, ESBL E. coli, and P. aeruginosa isolates, along with food-borne pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Listeria monocytogens ATCC 19111, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica BCRC 12986. This is the first report of HO-producing L. animalis 30a-2 and W. cibaria C34 isolated from the intestinal tracts of pigs and feces of dogs that have good antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant and food-borne pathogenic bacteria and have excellent probiotic properties."
"Prevalence and associated factors for carriage of Enterobacteriaceae producing ESBLs or carbapenemase and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Hong Kong community. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Hong Kong community to estimate the carriage prevalence, associated factors and genotypes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)."
"Optimizing a Screening Protocol for Potential Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase Escherichia coli on MacConkey Agar for Use in a Global Surveillance Program. The increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  is worrisome. Coordinated efforts to better understand global prevalence and risk factors are needed. Developing lower- and middle-income countries need reliable, readily available, and cost-effective solutions for detecting ESBL  to contribute to global surveillance. We evaluated MacConkey agar supplemented with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime as a screening method for accurately detecting and quantifying potential ESBL  MacConkey agar from eight manufacturers, representing seven countries, was prepared with 2 or 4 μg/ml ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Four  strains (NC11, ATCC 25922, CM-13457, and CM-10455) and one  strain (CM-11073) were grown overnight, serially diluted, and plated in triplicate for enumeration on all medium combinations. After recovery was assessed, US-1 MacConkey agar with cefotaxime was used to further evaluate the reproducibility and detection of potential ESBL  from poultry cecal ( = 30) and water ( = 30) samples. Results indicated the recovery of  13457 from four MacConkey agar manufacturers was reduced by up to 4 log CFU/ml, and phenotypic differences in colony size and color were apparent for each manufacturer for control  strains. A true ESBL, NC11, was not reduced with 4 μg/ml cefotaxime. From ceca and water, potential ESBL  isolates were only confirmed from MacConkey agar with 4 μg/ml cefotaxime, where 45% and 16.6% of  isolates phenotypically expressed ESBL production. The quality and reproducibility of MacConkey agar varied by manufacturer, which suggests that a single manufacturer and medium type should be selected for global monitoring efforts so that training and interpretation can be standardized."
"Incidence of community-onset extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing  and  infections: an 11-year population-based study in Denmark.  Data elucidating trends of community-onset extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  and  infections remain sparse in low prevalence areas. We conducted a population-based study to determine the incidence, temporal trends and co-resistance of community-onset ESBL infections. We identified all recorded episodes of  and  bacteraemia and urinary tract infections in adult patients (>15 years) in the North Denmark Region between 2007-2017. Using population-based registries, we obtained information on demographics and place of acquisition, and investigated the standardized incidence rates and temporal trends of community-onset ESBL infections and the associated patterns of co-resistance. A total of 3741 episodes of community-onset ESBL  or  infections were observed during the study period, with the annual standardized incidence rate increasing from 7.5 to 105 per 100,000 person-years between 2007-2017. The increase was conveyed primarily by a rise in  urinary tract infections shifting from being mainly healthcare-associated to community-acquired. ESBL-producing isolates increased from 0.5 to 4.0% with considerable co-resistance. The proportion of  and  isolates producing ESBL have increased considerably in the North Denmark Region. The increasing incidence and frequent co-resistance should raise awareness among physicians responsible for empirical antibiotic treatment."
"Antimicrobial susceptibility, biofilm formation and genetic profiles of Escherichia coli isolated from retail chicken meat. Brazil is the number one exporter of chicken meat, and this industry maintains constant microbiological vigilance. The objective of this study was to characterize the pathogenicity, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the profile of biofilm production of Escherchia coli strains isolated from raw refrigerated cuts of chicken meat sold in retail markets of the four largest poultry companies in Brazil. We collected 150 samples of chicken meat, in order to isolate E. coli and performed susceptibility tests (to amoxicillin associated with clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole). In addition, the disc approximation test to detect extended spectrum beta-lactamases enzymes (ESBLs) producers was performed. E. coli ability to form biofilm was checked using polystyrene microplates. We also searched for ESBLs genes (blaCTY-M2, blaSHV-1, blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M2, blaOXA-1, blaPSE-1 and AmpC) and adhesion genes (sfa/foc, afa/draB, iha, hrla, fimC, tsh, papC, mat, cr1, felA, fimH and papG) in ESBL-E. coli producers and in those E. coli classified as strongly biofilm formers, respectively. The overall percentage of E. coli isolation was 58.66%, with brand A having the highest percentage (70%), followed by brands D, B and C (60, 53.3 and 50%, respectively). The highest resistance profile was observed for beta-lactams (39.5%), followed by sulfonamide associated to trimethoprim (36.9%) and polymyxin (33.4%). Of the isolates obtained, 77% were non-susceptible to at least one antimicrobial. Brand A showed the highest overall percentage of resistance with 95.23%, followed by brands C (80%), B (75%) and D (69.44%). Overall, 73.86% of the isolates were non susceptible to at least one antibiotic and 36.3% were multiresistants. A total of 17.04% of E. coli strains were identified as ESBLs producers and 70.44% were able to form biofilms (moderate-to-strong). The blaTEM-1 gene was the most prevalent (73.33%), followed by blaSHV-1 (46.66%) and blaCMY-2 (6%). Of the 31 strongly biofilm-forming strains, 26 (83.87%), 24 (77.41%) and 20 (64.51%) expressed fimC, papG and crl genes, respectively. Taken together, our results show that Brazilian chicken meat can be contaminated with E. coli that are non-susceptible to multiple antibiotics, able to form biofilm and showing a diverse repertoire of adhesins linked to pathogenicity depending on the brand evaluated."
"Inactivation of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli by UVA-LED irradiation system. The prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli is increasing rapidly and spreading worldwide, particularly in Asia, compared to other regions. In the last ten years, in our hospital, in particular, there has been a < 30% increase. To prevent the spread of ESBL in hospitals and the community, the ultraviolet (UV) A-light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation device was used to inactivate ESBL-E. coli in human livestock and the environment. ESBL-E. coli and E. coli bacterial samples were collected from patients at Tokushima University Hospital (Tokushima City, Japan). The UVA-LED irradiation system had 365 nm single wavelength, and the current of the circuit was set to 0.23 or 0.50 A consistently. Results demonstrated that UVA-LED was useful for the inactivation of ESBL-E. coli and E. coli. The minimum energy dosage required to inactivate ESBL-E. coli and E. coli was 40.76 J/cm2 (45 min) in the first type of UVA-LED and 38.85 J/cm2 (5 min) in the second type. There were no significant differences between ESBL-E. coli and E. coli. The inactivation of ESBL-E. coli was dependent on energy. These findings suggest that UVA-LED with 365 nm single wavelength could be useful for surface decontamination in healthcare facilities. J. Med. Invest. 67 : 163-169, February, 2020."
"Performance of the Check-Direct ESBL Screen for BD MAX for detection of asymptomatic faecal carriage of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Accurte diagnostic methods are crucial for the detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E). Besides culture-based gold-standard methods, new molecular gene detection tests are reaching the market. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of the direct quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based methods Check-Direct ESBL and CPE Screen for BD MAX in relation to traditional culture-based methods for detection of ESBL-E faecal carriage."
"Semi-quantitative cultures of throat and rectal swabs are efficient tests to predict ESBL-Enterobacterales ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated ESBL carriers. In ICU patients with carriage of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) and suspected Gram-negative bacilli ventilator-associated pneumonia (GNB-VAP), the quantification of the rectal and throat ESBL-E carriage might predict the ESBL-E involvement in GNB-VAP. Our aim was to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative assessment of rectal/throat ESBL-E carriage can predict ESBL-E-associated VAP in medical ICU patients."
"Antimicrobial resistance pattern of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing  isolated from fecal samples of piglets and pig farm workers of selected organized farms of India. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  are gradually increasing worldwide and carry a serious public threat. This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern of ESBL-producing  isolated from fecal samples of piglets and pig farm workers."
"Fecal Carriage of Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase and Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales Strains in Patients with Colorectal Cancer in the Oncology Unit of Amizour Hospital, Algeria: A Prospective Cohort Study.  The prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) is now disseminated worldwide. This study aims to describe the prevalence of ESBL and CPE fecal carriage in colorectal cancer patients.  All patients admitted to the oncology service of Amizour hospital (Algeria) for colorectal cancer chemotherapy from March to May 2019 were screened for ESBL-E or CPE fecal carriage. After culturing on chromogenic media, the presumptive colonies were identified by mass spectroscopy. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. The β-lactamases encoding genes and plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistant genes were screened by PCR and sequencing.  ESBL-E strains were recovered from rectal swabs in 6 patients (14.3%) and only 1 patient (2.4%) was found a carrier for OXA-48-producing . The most frequently encountered species among ESBL-E was  ( = 5), followed by  ( = 1). PCR and sequencing showed that four isolates harbored the  gene and two strains harbored the  gene. Also, one strain of  was found to harbor both  and  genes.  This study highlighted the fecal carriage of ESBL-E and OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales strains in colorectal cancer patients."
"Bacteremia Caused by Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae in Vientiane, Lao PDR: A 5-Year Study. Although there has been an increasing incidence of bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) across South East Asia, there are sparse data from the Lao PDR, where laboratory capacity for antimicrobial resistance surveillance is limited. We, therefore, retrospectively reviewed bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing  and  between 2010 and 2014 at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Lao PDR. Clinical and laboratory data relating to all episodes of ESBL-E bacteremia were reviewed over the 5-year period and compared with non-ESBL-E bacteremia. Blood cultures positive for  or  were identified retrospectively from laboratory records. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from research databases and case notes and analyzed using STATA. Between 2010 and 2014, we identified 360 patients with  ( = 249) or  ( = 111) bacteremia, representing 34.8% of all patients with clinically significant bacteremia Seventy-two (20%) isolates produced ESBL;  accounted for 15.3% (55/360) and  for 4.7% (17/360), respectively. The incidence of ESBL-producing  bacteremia rose during the study period. By multiple logistic analysis, reported antibiotic use in the previous week was significantly associated with ESBL positivity ( < 0.001, odds ratio 3.89). Although multiresistant, most ESBL-producing  and  remained susceptible to meropenem (65/65; 100%) and amikacin (64/65; 98.5%). We demonstrated an alarming increase in the incidence of ESBL-E as a cause of bacteremia in Vientiane during the study period. This has implications for empiric therapy of sepsis in Laos, and ongoing surveillance is essential."
"Prevalence and Risk Factor for Antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli Colonization at Birth in Premature Infants: A Prospective Cohort Study. Escherichia coli causes neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) that is associated with high mortality and increasing antibiotic resistance. Thus, we estimated the prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for colonization of E. coli in premature infants at birth and characterized the pathogenicity of the isolates."
"Seasonality in carriage of extended-spectrum -lactamase-producing  and  in the general population: a pooled analysis of nationwide cross-sectional studies. Infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are often preceded by asymptomatic carriage. Higher incidences in enteric infectious diseases during summer have been reported. Here, we assessed whether the presence of seasonality in intestinal ESBL-Escherichia coli/Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-E/K) carriage in the general Dutch population exists. From 2014 to 2017, the faecal carriage of ESBL-E/K in healthy individuals was determined in three cross-sectional studies in the Netherlands, including 5985 subjects. Results were pooled to identify seasonal trends in prevalence (by month of sampling). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results were adjusted for age, sex, antibiotic use and travel. Overall prevalence of ESBL-E/K carriage was 4.3% (n = 260 ESBL-E/K-positive), with differences between months ranging from 2.6% to 7.4%. Compared to January, the monthly prevalence of ESBL-E carriage was highest in August (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.02-3.49) and September (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.30-3.89). The observed monthly differences in ESBL-E/K carriage rates suggest that there is seasonal variation in exposure to ESBL-E/K other than due to travelling and antibiotic use. This should be taken into account in designing future ESBL-E prevalence studies in temperate regions."
"Population-level exposures associated with MRSA and ESBL-E. coli infection across district health boards in Aotearoa New Zealand: an ecological study. National responses to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) require an understanding of the factors driving its development and spread. Research to date has primarily focused on determining individual-level risk factors for AMR-associated infections. However, additional insights may be gained by investigating exposures associated with AMR variation at the population level."
"Antimicrobial potential of the food-grade additive carvacrol against uropathogenic E. coli based on membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species generation, and molecular docking analysis. The antibiotic resistance of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli has increased drastically in recent years. In our study, we determined the principle mechanisms of action for the food-grade additive carvacrol against ESBL E. coli isolated from the blood of patients with a urinary tract infection. Carvacrol, which has a minimum inhibitory concentration of 150 μg/ml and a minimum bactericidal concentration of 300 μg/ml, reduced E. coli cell counts in a time-dependent manner. After treatment with carvacrol, the E. coli killing time was found to be 120 min. Fluorescent staining confirmed an increase in bacterial cell death, greater membrane depolarization, and an elevated oxidative burst in carvacrol-treated E. coli. Carvacrol also induced the release of cellular DNA, proteins, and potassium ions from bacterial cells and reduced both the number of E. coli in invasion assays against macrophages and the levels of the inflammatory proteins TNF-α and COX-2. In addition, carvacrol was found to inhibit β-lactamase enzyme activity (in vitro), which was supported by in silico results. Moreover, carvacrol inhibited motility, and protected against bacterial invasion. Overall, the findings suggest that carvacrol has significant antimicrobial potential against ESBL E. coli."
"Recurrence of urinary tract infections with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli caused by homologous strains among which clone ST131-O25b is dominant. Bacterial features associated with recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs) due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producingEscherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) are not well understood. In this study, phylogenetic groups and ST131 subclones were investigated to assess strain homology of ESBL-E. coli isolates in patients with RUTIs in inpatient and outpatient settings in western Sweden."
"In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Various Cefoperazone/Sulbactam Products.  This study aims to assess the in vitro activity of different samples of cefoperazone/sulbactam (CFP/SUL) against multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Clinical isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-, ESBL-, carbapenem-resistant   (CR-AB), and carbapenem-resistant  (CR-PA) were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and time-killing methods were used to assess and compare the in vitro activities of different samples of cefoperazone/sulbactam (CFP/SUL) against these MDROs. For ESBL-E. coli, ESBL-K. pneumoniae, and CR-PA, product C had smaller variations than product A and B (p < 0.05). For CR-AB, product B had the largest variation compared to the other two products (p < 0.05). In the time-killing studies, significant differences among the products when used at 16/16 µg/mL were noted for ESBL-E. coli, ESBL-K. pneumoniae, and CR-AB isolates. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the significantly different activity of different products of CFP/SUL against MDROs."
"Presence of pathogenic bacteria in faeces from dogs fed raw meat-based diets or dry kibble. Feeding dogs with raw meat-based diets (RMBD) has increased in popularity in recent years. Proponents claim that RMBD is more natural for dogs, because it is what their ancestors (wolves) eat. Opponents claim that RMBD is a health hazard to both humans and animals, with a risk of spreading zoonotic bacteria and resistant bacterial strains."
"Extended-Spectrum β-lactamase-Producing  Shedding in Farm Horses Versus Hospitalized Horses: Prevalence and Risk Factors.  We aimed to investigate the prevalence, molecular characteristics and risk factors of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  (ESBL-E) shedding in horses. A prospective study included three cohorts: (i) farm horses (13 farms, n = 192); (ii) on hospital admission (n = 168) and; (iii) horses hospitalized for ≥72 h re-sampled from cohort (ii) (n = 86). Enriched rectal swabs were plated, ESBL-production was confirmed (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)) and genes were identified (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). Identification and antibiotic susceptibility were determined (Vitek-2). Medical records and owners' questionnaires were analyzed. Shedding rates increased from 19.6% (n = 33/168) on admission to 77.9% (n = 67/86) during hospitalization ( < 0.0001, odds ratio (OR) = 12.12). Shedding rate in farms was 20.8% (n = 40/192), significantly lower compared to hospitalized horses ( < 0.0001). The main ESBL-E species (n = 192 isolates) were  (59.9%, 115/192),  sp. (17.7%, 34/192) and  (13.0%, 25/192). The main gene group was CTX-M-1 (56.8%). A significant increase in resistance rates to chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim-sulpha was identified during hospitalization. Risk factors for shedding in farms included breed (Arabian, OR = 3.9), sex (stallion, OR = 3.4), and antibiotic treatment (OR = 9.8). Older age was identified as a protective factor (OR = 0.88). We demonstrated an ESBL-E reservoir in equine cohorts, with a significant ESBL-E acquisition, which increases the necessity to implement active surveillance and antibiotic stewardship programs."
"Light-Activatable Synergistic Therapy of Drug-Resistant Bacteria-Infected Cutaneous Chronic Wounds and Nonhealing Keratitis by Cupriferous Hollow Nanoshells. Due to the inability to spontaneously heal and vulnerability to bacterial infection, diabetic patients are frustrated by unexpected epithelium injuries in daily life. Notably, a drug-resistant bacterial infection may result in a long-term impact to the natural function of damaged organs. It is imperative to develop strategies that promote injury recovery and eradicate drug-resistant infection simultaneously. Here, we present a composite structured cupriferous hollow nanoshell (AuAgCuO NS) that consists of a hollow gold-silver (AuAg) core and CuO shell as a photothermal therapeutic agent for a cutaneous chronic wound and nonhealing keratitis with drug-resistant bacterial infection. The controllable photothermal therapeutic effect and released silver ion from the hollow AuAg core possess a synergistic effect to eradicate multi-drug-resistant bacteria, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase  (ESBL ) and methicillin-resistant  (MRSA). Meanwhile, the released copper ion from the CuO shell could expedite endothelial cell angiogenesis and fibroblast cell migration, thus boosting wound-healing effects. In both infection-complicated disease models, the ophthalmic clinical score, wound closure rates, and histopathology analysis demonstrate that the AuAgCuO NSs could facilitate the re-epithelialization at the wound area and eliminate the complicated bacterial infection from diabetic mice. A primary signal path involved in the promoted healing effect was further illustrated by comprehensive assays of immunohistochemical evaluation, Western blot, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, our AuAgCuO NSs are shown to be potent candidates for clinical utilization in the treatment of diabetic epithelium injuries."
"Ability of Three Lactic Acid Bacteria to Grow in Sessile Mode and to Inhibit Biofilm Formation of Pathogenic Bacteria. In this study, we explored the effect of three lactic acid bacteria (LAB), i.e. Enterococcus sp CM9, Enterococcus sp CM18 and Enterococcus faecium H3, and their supernatants, on seven biofilm-forming pathogenic strains isolated from human urinary tract or nose infections. By quantitative biofilm production assay, a strong adherence ability of Enterococcus sp CM9 and Enterococcus sp CM18 was revealed while E. faecium H3 resulted to be moderately adherent. Inhibition tests demonstrated an antimicrobial activity of LAB against pathogens.The presence of cell free supernatant (CFS) of CM9 and CM18 strains significantly decreased the adhesion of S. aureus 10,850, S. epidermidis 4,296 and E. coli FSL24. The CFS of H3 strain was effective against S. epidermidis 4,296 and P. aeruginosa PA1FSL biofilms only. Biofilm formation of K. pneumoniae Kp20FSL, A. baumannii AB8FSL and ESBL+ E. coli FS101570 have not been affected by any CSF while P. aeruginosa PA1FSL biofilm increase in presence of CM9 and CM18 CFS.Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy revealed that K. pneumoniae Kp20FSL biofilm was inhibited by Enterococcus sp CM9, when grown together.Our results suggest that the LAB strains and/or their bacteriocins can be considered as potential tools to control biofilm formation of some bacterial pathogens."
"Antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative bacteria: A six-year longitudinal study in a hospital in Saudi Arabia. Increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a major concern especially in light of lack of new antimicrobial agents.

"Decreasing prevalence of contamination with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) in retail chicken meat in the Netherlands. Retail chicken meat is a potential source of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E). In the past decade, vast national efforts were undertaken to decrease the antibiotic use in the veterinary sector, resulting in a 58% decrease in antibiotic sales in the sector between 2009 and 2014. This decrease in antibiotic use was followed by a decrease in ESBL-E prevalence in broilers. The current study investigates the prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E in retail chicken meat purchased in the Netherlands between December 2013 and August 2015. It looks at associations between the prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E and sample characteristics such as method of farming (free-range or conventional), supermarket chain of purchase and year of purchase. In the current study, 352 chicken meat samples were investigated for the presence of ESBL-E using selective culture methods. Six samples were excluded due to missing isolates or problems obtaining a good quality sequence leaving 346 samples for further analyses. Of these 346 samples, 188 (54.3%) were positive for ESBL-E, yielding 216 ESBL-E isolates (Escherichia coli (n = 204), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 11) and Escherichia fergusonii (n = 1)). All ESBL-E isolates were analysed using whole-genome sequencing. The prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E in retail chicken meat decreased from 68.3% in 2014 to 44.6% in 2015, absolute risk difference 23.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.6% - 34.1%). The ESBL-E prevalence was lower in free-range chicken meat (36.4%) compared with conventional chicken meat (61.5%), absolute risk difference 25.2% (95% CI: 12.9% - 36.5%). The prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E varied between supermarket chains, the highest prevalence of contamination was found in supermarket chain 4 (76.5%) and the lowest in supermarket chain 1 (37.8%). Pairwise isolate comparisons using whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) showed that clustering of isolates occurs more frequently within supermarket chains than between supermarket chains. In conclusion, the prevalence of contamination with ESBL-E in retail chicken in the Netherlands decreased over time; nevertheless, it remains substantial and as such a potential source for ESBL-E in humans."
"Prevalence, genetic diversity of and factors associated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales carriage in residents of French nursing homes.

"Quantification and long-term carriage study of human extended-spectrum/AmpC β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli after international travel to Vietnam. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase/AmpC β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL/AmpC-E. coli) are common in developing countries and travellers represent potential reservoirs for their dissemination. The aim of this study was to quantify cefotaxime (CTX)-resistant E. coli harboured by travellers to Vietnam and to conduct a follow-up study."
"Prevalence Of  Among Cefotaxime-Resistant Commensal  In Residents Of Vietnam. The dissemination of colistin-resistant bacteria harboring the colistin-resistance gene  in developing countries has recently entered the spotlight as an emerging public health threat, which is attributed to the abuse of colistin use in these countries. However, the prevalence of these bacteria in developing countries has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant commensal  harboring  among residents of a representative Vietnamese village and assessed the characteristics of these isolates."
"Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in human-derived and foodchain-derived samples from England, Wales, and Scotland: an epidemiological surveillance and typing study. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates (ESBL-E coli) cause more than 5000 cases of bacteraemias annually in the UK. The contribution of the food chain to these infections is debated. We aimed to identify the most important reservoirs of ESBL-E coli that colonise and infect humans to identify strategic intervention points."
"Diversity and trends in population structure of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in febrile urinary tract infections in children in France from 2014 to 2017. The population structure of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli evolves over time, notably due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant clones such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E)."
"Prevalence, risk factors and genetic characterisation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E and CPE): a community-based cross-sectional study, the Netherlands, 2014 to 2016. BackgroundThe epidemiology of carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL-E) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in the general population is unknown.AimIn this observational study, the prevalence and risk factors for intestinal ESBL-E and CPE carriage in the Dutch general population were determined. ESBL-E were characterised.MethodsFrom 2014 to 2016, ca 2,000 residents were invited monthly to complete a questionnaire and provide a faecal sample, which was tested for ESBL-E. The first 1,758 samples were also tested for CPE. Risk factors for ESBL-E carriage were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. ESBL-E isolates underwent whole genome sequencing.ResultsOf 47,957 individuals invited, 4,177 (8.7%) completed the questionnaire and provided a faecal sample. ESBL-E were detected in 186 (4.5%) individuals, resulting in an adjusted prevalence of 5.0% (95% confidence interval (CI):3.4-6.6%). Risk factors were: born outside the Netherlands (odds ratio (OR): 1.99; 95% CI: 1.16-4.54), eating in restaurants > 20 times/year (OR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.04-2.76), antibiotic use < 6 months ago (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.05-4.03), swimming in sea/ocean < 12 months ago (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.11-2.39), travelling to Africa (OR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.23-7.46) or Asia (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.02-3.90) < 12 months ago, and not changing kitchen towels daily (OR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.24-3.87). The last had the largest population attributable risk (PAR) (47.5%). Eighty-four of 189 (44.4%) ESBL-E isolates carried  .  isolates belonged to 70 different sequence types (ST)s, of which ST131 (42/178 isolates; 23.6%) was most prevalent. Associations were observed between IncFIA plasmids and ST131 and  , and between IncI1 and ST88 and  . No CPE were detected.ConclusionsThe prevalence of ESBL-E carriage in the Netherlands' community-dwelling population is 5.0%. Identified risk factors were mostly travelling (particularly to Asia and Africa) and kitchen hygiene. CPE were not detected."
"Treatment of urinary tract infections in the era of antimicrobial resistance and new antimicrobial agents. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are a growing concern due to limited treatment options. Knowledge of the common uropathogens in addition to local susceptibility patterns is essential in determining appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy of UTIs. The recommended first-line empiric antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in otherwise healthy adult nonpregnant females is a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin, a 3-g single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine, or a 5-day course of pivmecillinam. High rates of resistance for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin preclude their use as empiric treatment of UTIs in several communities, particularly if patients who were recently exposed to them or in patients who are at risk of infections with extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriales. Second-line options include oral cephalosporins such as cephalexin or cefixime, fluoroquinolones and β-lactams, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. Current treatment options for UTIs due to AmpC- β -lactamase-producing Enterobacteriales include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, fluoroquinolones, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems. Treatment oral options for UTIs due to ESBLs- include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, finafloxacin, and sitafloxacin while pivmecillinam, fosfomycin, finafloxacin, and sitafloxacin are treatment oral options for ESBLs- . Parenteral treatment options for UTIs due to ESBLs-producing  include piperacillin-tazobactam (for ESBL- only), carbapenems including meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin-relebactam, and sulopenem, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, aminoglycosides including plazomicin, cefiderocol, fosfomycin, sitafloxacin, and finafloxacin. Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin-relebactam, colistin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and ceftazidime-avibactam, aztreonam and amoxicillin-clavulanate, aminoglycosides including plazomicin, cefiderocol, tigecycline are treatment options for UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriales (CRE). Treatment options for UTIs caused by multidrug resistant (MDR)- spp. include fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems including imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam, meropenem, and fosfomycin, ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, aminoglycosides including plazomicin, aztreonam and ceftazidime-avibactam, cefiderocol, and colistin. It is important to use the new antimicrobials wisely for treatment of UTIs caused by MDR-organisms to avoid resistance development."
"Changing epidemiology of bloodstream infection in a 25-years hematopoietic stem cell transplant program: current challenges and pitfalls on empiric antibiotic treatment impacting outcomes. We aimed to describe epidemiology changes in bloodstream infections (BSI) episodes in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients throughout a 25-year period (1993-2017), comparing five-year time spans, and we evaluate their impact on inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (IEAT) and mortality. During the study period, 1164 BSI episodes were documented in patients undergoing HSCT (71.6% allogenic and 29% autologous). A significant decrease in gram-positive cocci (GPC) and increase in gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were observed (p < 0.001). Among GP, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) significantly decreased whereas rising E. faecium BSI was documented. Among GNB, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae rates increased. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) GNB, especially ESBL-E. coli and MDR-P. aeruginosa, emerged in 2008 and has gradually increased. IEAT against MDR-P. aeruginosa, but not in other MDR-GNB, augmented throughout the study period. Overall, 30-day and related mortality rates were 12.7% and 7.7% respectively, both increasing over time (p < 0.001 and p = 0.025). In GNB, 30-day and related mortality were 18.5% and 12.8%, respectively, increasing over time (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004). To conclude, important BSI epidemiological changes were described in a 25-year period. Concerning increase in IEAT for P. aeruginosa infections and rising 30-day mortality rate were documented."
"Emergence of diversity in carbapenemase-producing  ST131, England, January 2014 to June 2016. Background ST131, a global, high-risk clone, comprises fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) mutations and CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases associated with the 30-encoding clades, C1 and C2. Further carbapenem resistance development in ST131 is a public health concern.AimThis observational study aimed to probe the diversity of carbapenemase-producing  (CP ) ST131 across England.MethodsST131 isolates were identified using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data generated for all non-duplicate CP  from human samples submitted to the national reference laboratory from January 2014 to June 2016. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene content and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were compared against a published ST131 phylogeny and analysed alongside patient metadata.ResultsThirty-nine genetically diverse ST131 CP , from eight of nine regions, represented 10% of CP  isolates sequenced. Ten and eight isolates were from the FQ-susceptible (FQ-S) clades A and B, while eight and 15 isolates belonged to the FQ-R clades C1 or C2, respectively. Seven distinct carbapenemases were identified: KPC-2 (21 isolates, 6 regions) frequently occurred among clade C2 isolates (n = 10). OXA-48-producers (10 isolates, 3 regions) were often from clade A (n = 5). NDM-1 (n = 4), NDM-5 (n = 1), VIM-1 (n = 1), VIM-4 (n = 1) and OXA-181 (n = 1) were also identified. Clade C2 isolates encoded more AMR genes than those from clades A (p = 0.02), B (p = 9.6 x 10-3) or C1 (p = 0.03).ConclusionWhen compared with its global predominance among ESBL- ST131 represented a fraction of the CP  received, belonging to diverse clades and encoding diverse carbapenemases. The greater accumulation of resistance genes in clade C2 isolates highlights the need for ongoing monitoring of this high-risk lineage."
